# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Django project demonstrating modern GraphQL API development using Strawberry GraphQL. The project uses Django 5.1+ with Python 3.12+ and the uv package manager.

## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Database setup
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata berries
```

### Running the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
# Access GraphQL endpoints at:
# - http://localhost:8000/graphql (async)
# - http://localhost:8000/graphql/sync (sync)
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with file watching
pytest-watcher

# Run a specific test file
pytest src/envision/core/tests/test_example.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Linting and formatting with Ruff
ruff check src/
ruff format src/

# Type checking with MyPy
mypy
```

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- `src/envision/` - Main Django project directory
  - `settings/base.py` - Django configuration
  - `core/` - Core application module containing models, GraphQL schema, and API logic
    - `models.py` - Django models (Fruit, Color)
    - `schema.py` - GraphQL schema definitions with queries and mutations
    - `types.py` - Strawberry GraphQL type definitions
    - `urls.py` - URL routing for GraphQL endpoints

### Key Components

1. **GraphQL Schema** (src/envision/core/schema.py):
   - Provides full CRUD operations for Fruit and Color models
   - Includes user registration mutation
   - Supports filtering, ordering, and pagination
   - Both async and sync endpoints available

2. **Models** (src/envision/core/models.py):
   - `Fruit`: Simple model with name and optional color relationship
   - `Color`: Model with name and reverse relationship to fruits

3. **Type Definitions** (src/envision/core/types.py):
   - Strawberry GraphQL types that correspond to Django models
   - Includes filtering and ordering capabilities

### Important Configuration Notes

- The project uses `uv` as the package manager (not pip directly)
- Django settings are in `src/envision/settings/base.py`
- Debug mode is currently enabled with a hardcoded secret key (development only)
- SQLite3 is used as the default database
- The project follows a src-layout structure

### Common Development Patterns

When adding new GraphQL functionality:
1. Define models in `models.py`
2. Create corresponding Strawberry types in `types.py`
3. Add queries/mutations to `schema.py`
4. Run migrations if models changed: `python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`

When modifying existing code:
- Follow the existing code style (Ruff will enforce this)
- Ensure type hints are used throughout (MyPy will check this)
- Add tests for new functionality in the appropriate test files

## Classes with fields

**Classes with fields** — `NamedTuple`, dataclasses — document every field in
an `Attributes` section:

```python
class QueryCase(NamedTuple):
    """One ORM query a lesson measures.

    Attributes
    ----------
    label : str
        Name the lesson refers to the query by.
    query_count : int
        Queries the ORM issued, the figure the lesson compares.
    """
```

A type says how a field is shaped, not what it holds. Describing each one
keeps that meaning next to the code, and anything that renders the class —
autodoc, a REPL, an editor tooltip — has a description to show instead of a
bare name.

## Doctests

**All functions and methods MUST have working doctests.** Doctests serve as both documentation and tests.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Doctests MUST actually execute - never comment out function calls or similar
- Doctests MUST NOT be converted to `.. code-block::` as a workaround (code-blocks don't run)
- If you cannot create a working doctest, **STOP and ask for help**

**Available tools for doctests:**
- `doctest_namespace` fixtures: `client`, `user`, `red_color`, `blue_color`, `strawberry`, `blueberry`, `raspberry`
- Django `settings` fixture (from pytest-django)
- Ellipsis for variable output: `# doctest: +ELLIPSIS`
- Update `conftest.py` to add new fixtures to `doctest_namespace`

**`# doctest: +SKIP` is NOT permitted** - it's just another workaround that doesn't test anything. Use fixtures properly.

**Using fixtures in doctests:**
```python
>>> from envision.core.models import Fruit
>>> Fruit.objects.count()  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
...
```

**When output varies, use ellipsis:**
```python
>>> strawberry.name  # strawberry from doctest_namespace
'Strawberry'
>>> strawberry.color  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
<Color: ...>
```

## Git Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format
```
Component/File(commit-type[Subcomponent/method]): Concise description

why: Explanation of necessity or impact.
what:
- Specific technical changes made
- Focused on a single topic
```

### Common Commit Types
- **feat**: New features or enhancements
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **refactor**: Code restructuring without functional change
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **chore**: Maintenance (dependencies, tooling, config)
- **test**: Test-related updates
- **style**: Code style and formatting

### Dependencies Commit Format
- Python packages: `py(deps): Package update`
- Python dev packages: `py(deps[dev]): Dev package update`

### Examples

#### Feature Addition
```
core/schema(feat[Query]): Add fruit filtering by color

why: Users need to filter fruits by color in GraphQL queries
what:
- Add color filter parameter to fruits query
- Update resolver to handle color filtering
- Add tests for color filtering
```

#### Bug Fix
```
core/types(fix[FruitType]): Correct optional color relationship

why: Color field was incorrectly marked as required
what:
- Change color field to use Optional type
- Update tests to handle None values
```

#### Dependencies Update
```
py(deps[dev]): Add django-stubs for type checking

why: Improve type safety for Django models and ORM
what:
- Add django-stubs to dev dependencies
- Configure MyPy to use django-stubs plugin
```
For multi-line commits, use heredoc to preserve formatting:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(Component[method]) add feature description

why: Explanation of the change.
what:
- First change
- Second change
EOF
)"
```

### Guidelines
- Subject line: Maximum 50 characters
- Body lines: Maximum 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", not "Added", "Fixed")
- One topic per commit
- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Mark breaking changes: `BREAKING:`

## Documentation Standards

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are paste-and-run units: pasting one block runs exactly one
intended action. Doctests and other executed examples are exempt — the test
suite runs them, nobody pastes them.

- **One command per block.** Multiple steps may share a block only when
  explicitly chained with `&&`, `;`, or `\` continuations — the chain is
  then one logical command.
- **Explanations go in prose above the block**, never as `#` comments inside it.
- **Command menus are per-command blocks with prose lead-ins**, not tables.
- **Shell commands use the `console` tag with a `$ ` prefix.** This separates
  interactive commands from scripts and enables prompt-aware copy.
- **Split long commands with `\`** — one flag or flag+value pair per indented
  continuation line, positional arguments last.

Good:

Show the last ten commits as a graph:

```console
$ git log \
    --max-count=10 \
    --graph \
    --oneline
```

Bad:

```console
# Show the last ten commits as a graph
$ git log --max-count=10 --graph --oneline
```

## AI Slop Prevention

Treat AI slop as **review-hostile noise**, not as proof that text or
code is wrong. The goal is to maximize information density by removing
artifacts that make the repository harder to trust or navigate.

### The Anti-Slop Rubric

Before committing, audit all AI-assisted changes for these noise
patterns:

- **AI Signatures:** Remove "Generated by", footers, conversational
  filler ("Certainly!", "Here is..."), unexplained emojis (🤖, ✨), and
  AI-tool metadata.
- **Brittle References:** Avoid hard-coded line numbers, fragile
  file/test counts, dated "as of" claims, bare SHAs, and local
  absolute paths unless they are strict evidentiary artifacts (e.g.,
  benchmark logs).
- **Diff Narration:** Do not restate what moved, was renamed, or was
  removed in artifacts the downstream reader holds: code, docstrings,
  README, CHANGES, PR descriptions, or release notes. The diff and
  commit message already carry this history.
- **Branch-Internal Narrative:** Do not mention intermediate branch
  states, abandoned approaches, or "no longer" behavior unless users
  of a published release actually experienced the old state (**The
  Published-Release Test**).
- **Low-Value Scaffolding:** Remove ownerless TODOs (`TODO: revisit`),
  unused future-proofing, debug artifacts, and defensive wrappers that
  do not protect a currently reachable failure mode.
- **Prose Inflation:** Replace generic AI "tells" like *comprehensive,
  robust, seamless, production-ready, leverage, delve, tapestry,* and
  *best practices* with concrete descriptions of behavior,
  constraints, or trade-offs.
- **Coded Labels:** Write rules, options, and findings as plain
  imperatives. Don't tag them with codes like `[R1]`, `A1`, or
  `Option B` in artifacts a human reads — the reader shouldn't have to
  decode an index. Internal agent bookkeeping may use ids; shipped text
  may not.

### Durable Source Links

Link to a pinned revision, never to trunk. A pinned permalink is not a
brittle reference; an unlinked SHA dropped into prose is. `blob/main/…`
links rot silently — the file moves, lines shift, and the anchor lands
on unrelated code while still resolving.

- Prefer a release tag (`blob/v1.4.0/…`). Most durable, and it tells
  the reader which released version the claim held for.
- Otherwise use a 7-char commit ref (`blob/9a29b1a/…`) reachable from
  trunk. Use when there is no tag or the claim is about unreleased
  code. Never a PR-head SHA — it can be rebased or garbage-collected.
- Reserve `blob/main/…` for living documents meant to always show the
  latest state, such as a contributing guide.
- Line anchors (`#L120-L145`) are only safe on a pinned ref.

### Preservation & Context

**When unsure, leave the text in place and ask.** Subjective cleanup
must never be a reason to remove load-bearing rationale.

- **Preserve the "Why":** You MUST NOT delete comments that document
  invariants, protocol constraints, platform quirks, security
  boundaries, and upstream workarounds.
- **Evidence is Immune:** Preserve exact counts, dates, and SHAs when
  they serve as evidence in benchmark results, release notes, stack
  traces, or lockfiles.
- **Behavior Over Inventory:** A useful description explains what
  changed for the *system or user*; it does not provide an inventory
  of files or functions the diff already shows.

### The Published-Release Test

Long-running branches accumulate tactical decisions — renames,
refactors, attempts-then-reverts. When deciding what counts as
branch-internal, use trunk or the parent branch as the baseline — not
intermediate states inside the current branch. Ask:

> Did users of the most recently published release ever experience
> this old name, old behavior, or bug?

If the answer is **no**, it is branch-internal narrative. Move it to
the commit message and describe only the final state in the artifact.

**Keep in shipped artifacts:**
- Deprecations and migration guides for symbols that actually shipped.
- `### Fixes` entries for bugs that affected users of a published
  release.
- Comments explaining *why the current code looks this way*
  (invariants, platform quirks) that make sense to a reader who never
  saw the previous version.

### Cleanup in Hindsight

When applying these rules retroactively from inside a feature branch,
first establish scope by diffing against the parent branch (or trunk)
to identify which commits this branch actually introduced. Then:

- **In-branch commits:** Prompt the user with two options: `fixup!`
  commits with `git rebase --autosquash` to address each causal commit
  at its source, or a single cleanup commit at branch tip.
- **Trunk/Parent commits:** Default to leaving them alone. Act only on
  explicit user instruction. If the user opts in, fold the cleanup
  into a single commit at branch tip; do not rewrite shared history.
- **Scope guard:** If cleaning prior slop would touch a colleague's
  work or expand the branch beyond its stated goal, stay in lane:
  protect the current goal and leave prior slop alone.

### Change Discipline

- Make the smallest coherent change that solves the verified problem;
  keep unrelated cleanup out of it.
- Reuse an existing file, component, helper, API, or test before adding
  a new one. Modify in place when the change fits the file's
  responsibility.
- Keep new APIs private until a caller outside the module needs them.
- Add a file only for a durable boundary — a distinct responsibility,
  independent reuse, or splitting an oversized high-touch module — not
  for a single-use helper or a one-line re-export.

### Keep Instructions Lean

Treat this file like code and prune it.

- Delete a line whose removal would not cause a mistake.
- Move multi-step procedures into skills, path-specific rules into
  nested AGENTS.md files, and hard limits into hooks or CI.
- Keep only non-obvious, broadly applicable defaults here. Anything a
  reader can infer from the code, a manifest, or a linter does not
  belong.
